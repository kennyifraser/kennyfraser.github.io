I'm a freelance website designer and front end developer with over 17 years of operational and online marketing experience relating to small businesses in the UK.

In 1999 I created the Scottish and Celtic music specialist retail website [Music Scotland](http://www.musicscotland.com/) and ran this business as owner-manager from locations in Edinburgh, Stirling and the Isle of Mull. In 2005 the business won the <span itemprop="award">Scots Trad Music Awards Services To Industry Award</span>. In 2011 it was sold as a going concern to another Scottish music store, Oban Music. Music Scotland has sent CDs, DVDs and books to tens of thousands of customers worldwide - music mainly generated in Scotland by Scottish artists.

Since then I've been supporting small business clients running their own websites. I now live back in my home town on the rural [Black Isle](http://www.black-isle.info/), near Inverness in the Scottish Highlands, with my wife and two children.  

I also own and manage a [self catering holiday cottage in Tobermory](http://mull.co) on the Isle of Mull, called Back Brae Lodge. I'm a member of the [Highland Web Group](http://www.meetup.com/Highland-Web-Group/).

In a former life I was an itinerant musician with [Salsa Celtica](http://salsaceltica.com) and other bands, performing internationally and teaching Scottish traditional music. In an even former life, [Edinburgh University](http://www.ed.ac.uk/) gave me a degree in Biochemistry.
