In <time datetime="1999">1999</time> I created the Scottish and Celtic music specialist retail website [Music Scotland](//www.musicscotland.com/).
I ran this business as owner-manager from locations in Edinburgh, Stirling and the Isle of Mull.
In <time datetime="2005">2005</time> the business won the <span itemprop="award">Scots Trad Music Awards Services To Industry Award</span>.
In <time datetime="2011">2011</time> it was sold as a going concern to another Scottish music store, Oban Music.
Music Scotland has sent CDs, DVDs and books to tens of thousands of customers worldwide, most of this music created by Scottish artists.

After <time datetime="2011">2011</time> I worked freelance, creating and/or supporting an operational web presence
for a wide range of [client businesses](/clients).
These included online retailers, record companies, accommodation providers, agricultural suppliers and
medical-scientific organisations.

Between 2017 and 2019 I was part of the Webteam at the [University of the Highlands and Islands](//www.uhi.ac.uk/en/), working on the University's content management system, supporting users and developing the front end.

I live on the rural [Black Isle](//www.black-isle.info/), near Inverness in the Scottish Highlands, with my wife and two children.  I own and manage Back Brae Lodge, a [self catering holiday cottage in Tobermory](//mull.co) on the Isle of Mull.

In a former life I was a musician, performing internationally with [Salsa Celtica](//salsaceltica.com) and other bands, and teaching Scottish traditional music with [Feisean Nan Gaidheal](//feisean.org/). In an even former life, [Edinburgh University](//www.ed.ac.uk/) gave me a degree in Biochemistry.
