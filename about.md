I'm a website designer, front end developer and digital marketer with over 17 years of experience in Scotland and the wider UK.

In 1999 I created the Scottish and Celtic music specialist retail website [Music Scotland](//www.musicscotland.com/) and ran this business as owner-manager from locations in Edinburgh, Stirling and the Isle of Mull. In 2005 the business won the <span itemprop="award">Scots Trad Music Awards Services To Industry Award</span>. In 2011 it was sold as a going concern to another Scottish music store, Oban Music. Music Scotland has sent CDs, DVDs and books to tens of thousands of customers worldwide, most of this music created by Scottish artists.

Since then I've been working freelance, creating and/or supporting an operational web presence for a wide range of [client businesses](/clients), including online retailers, record companies, accommodation providers, agricultural suppliers and medical-scientific organisations.

I live on the rural [Black Isle](//www.black-isle.info/), near Inverness in the Scottish Highlands, with my wife and two children.  I own and manage Back Brae Lodge, a [self catering holiday cottage in Tobermory](//mull.co) on the Isle of Mull. For several years I've been involved in running the Highlands & Islands branch of the medical charity [Crohn's & Colitis UK](//www.crohnsandcolitis.org.uk/get-involved/volunteering/local-group/scotland-northern-ireland/highlands-islands).  I'm a member of the [Highland Web Group](//www.meetup.com/Highland-Web-Group/), an informal meetup of local web professionals.

In a former life I was a musician, performing internationally with [Salsa Celtica](//salsaceltica.com) and other bands, and teaching Scottish traditional music with [Feisean Nan Gaidheal](//feisean.org/). In an even former life, [Edinburgh University](//www.ed.ac.uk/) gave me a degree in Biochemistry.
