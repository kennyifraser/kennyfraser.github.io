# Can I Help?

I design and build [responsive websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) with a [mobile first](http://www.lukew.com/resources/mobile_first.asp) approach, that adapt to the screen size of a wide range of devices. Sometimes I re-design existing sites, or rescue business owners who have specific website problems or are plain lost.

I endeavour to code to [web standard best practices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_standards) using modern [HTML5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) and [CSS3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) specifications.  I also work with [PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/intro-whatis.php), [JavaScript](http://javascript.about.com/od/reference/p/javascript.htm) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) where necessary.

I'm often integrating code into popular [content management systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content_management_system) including [ExpressionEngine](http://ellislab.com/expressionengine), [Statamic](http://www.statamic.com), [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/), which make it easier for a non-technical end user to add content. Despite this appearing to be a great advantage, this approach isn't appropriate for all circumstances and sometimes less complex website solutions fit better.

Some of my recent projects have involved implemention of responsive re-designs for [SellerDeck ecommerce websites](http://www.sellerdeck.co.uk/index.php/ecommerce-software/category/sellerdeck-desktop), software I've used since it was Actinic Catalog in the early 2000s.  If you're looking for a custom responsive design for a SellerDeck 2016 website, I can probably help you.

I work remotely as standard, with communication via [Skype](http://www.skype.com/en/) and [Remote Desktop](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/connect-using-remote-desktop-connection/) (or equivalent software), telephone, email or online chat.  Face-to-face meetings can be arranged where travel costs are covered.  I offer all clients free access to a separate project in my [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) account, and recommend all work is channelled through there. I use [GitHub](https://github.com/kennyifraser) for code sharing and version control.

# Shorter Projects or Introductory Sessions 

- investigate
- analyse
- problem-solve
- test
- advise
- document

For new projects I can offer a *discovery session* to find out about your needs and investigate any current web-based setup that you may have. After this I'd be able to advise on what I could do for you going forward.

After discussion of the project, I can offer a fixed quote in advance for a well-defined scope of work. 

# Longer or Ongoing Projects 

- design
- build
- maintain
- develop
- train
- support

For longer-term projects, a weekly rate for a 'sprint' of work towards an end goal is generally preferable.  This would be *iterative* in nature, broadly following [Agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#The_Agile_Manifesto) principles.

I'd consider a monthly retainer basis for regular, well-defined work or consultation.

Depending on timescale and budget, these projects would normally be under a mutually-agreed contract, based on either your or my template.
