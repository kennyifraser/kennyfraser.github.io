I'm looking forward to working with new clients - [contact me](#contact) if you think I may be able to help you.

Current availability: *within one month*

# Smaller Projects 

- investigate
- analyse
- problem-solve
- test
- advise
- document

For these I can offer a half-day rate.

# Larger or Ongoing Projects 

- design
- build
- maintain
- develop
- train
- support

For me to be able to offer a fixed quote would require a very well-defined project scope. 

An alternative is a weekly rate for a 'sprint' of work towards an end goal, generally following [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) principles.

I would consider a monthly retainer basis for regular, well-defined work or consultation.

Depending on timescale, these projects would be under a mutually-agreed contract.
