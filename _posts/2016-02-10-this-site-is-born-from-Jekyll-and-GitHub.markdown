I was considering moving my simple portfolio site [kennyfraser.com](http://kennyfraser.com) to a more streamlined publishing setup.  I wanted to get away from hand-coded HTML/CSS files and FTP, and add simple blog functionality.

After hearing good things about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) via [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) and seeing how tightly coupled it can be with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), I thought I'd forge ahead.  Ironically, after beginning the installation process yesterday, my existing Virtual Private Server host went down due to a power outage, taking my email forwarding with it.  No emails for coming up for 24 hours.  So managed to get a *lot* done...  

Jekyll seems to be the [most popular static site generator](https://www.staticgen.com/) out there at the moment.  My experience of building sites with the content management system [Statamic](http://statamic.com/) has been really good so far.  Statamic needs PHP on the server but the flat file construction looks on the surface pretty similar to Jekyll (which doesn't require any server scripting). 

Installation of Jekyll involved delving into the command line on OS X - I mainly used documentation at [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/), [Go Rails](https://gorails.com/setup/osx/10.11-el-capitan) (with Homebrew) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

The advantages pretty quicky made themselves clear:

- [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for writing blog posts and page content - as it should be
- easily generates a local server at *http://localhost:4000/* to preview the entire site, via the command line *jekyll serve*
- support for [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) generation of stylesheets
- code syntax highlighting
- performance - no database overhead 

My GitHub command line skills aren't yet fully formed, so I'm using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to commit changes to local files then push them to GitHub Pages.  Highlights here are:

- *everything* is version controllable
- quick and easy publishing with *Sync*
- speedy and reliable(?) hosting

There's plenty I'd still like to do, including:

- design the thing
- *.sass* syntax
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) (maybe)

Will I run into limitations later? Probably. But right now things are *quick and easy*, which is encouraging for sustainability of adding content.

Eduardo Bou√ßas has written a good [comparison of static vs dynamic site generators](https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators).
