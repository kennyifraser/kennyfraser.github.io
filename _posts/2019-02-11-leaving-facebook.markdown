title: "What, leaving Facebook? How dare you!"

Yep that's right. Leaving, one month short of 10 years of membership, it appears.  I still intend to continue to exist in real life though.  Here's my attempt to avoid the inevitable questions.

**But how will I get in touch with you in an Emergency?**

You might have my phone number.  And I'll still be on WhatsApp (yes I know it's owned by Facebook). Or you might know my lovely wife who's a Facebook and Instagram ninja/addict. You can pass on any really important messages if you really need to. Maybe I'll even post more on this blog, just important and interesting stuff of course.

**Aren't you just fundamentally anti-social?**

Hope not, but that's for you to judge. Smiley winky face.

**Are you concerned about privacy?**

Not too much, but kind of - and getting more so I think. There are always a lot of stories in the media but I thiknk we all prefer to make our own judgments based on evidence.

**Maybe I want to leave too.**

OK - here's a [guide to deleting Facebook](https://deletefacebook.com/) if you're thinking along the same lines.
