title: "What, leaving Facebook? How dare you!"

Yep that's right. Leaving, one month short of 10 years of membership, it appears.  I still intend to continue to exist in real life though.  Here's an effort to pre-empt the inevitable questions.

**WTF?**

Facebook just isn't useful, fun or rewarding enough for me any more, balanced against the time and energy it devours at regular intervals.  And most of the widely-shared content is crap, really. Overall, not using it at all is better than being part of it. I usually regret any time I've spent on it. That's the honest truth for me now, and I expect many others.

**Aren't you just fundamentally anti-social?**

Hope not, but that's for you to judge. Smiley winky face.

**But how will I get in touch with you in an Emergency?**

You might have my phone number or my email address.  I'll be on WhatsApp (I know, it's owned by Facebook) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kennyfraser) - in a limited way for now at least. Or you might know my lovely wife who's a Facebook and Instagram ninja/addict.

**So what's wrong with Facebook?**

They're pretty clever people, and they drive engagement with their platform in subtle and insidious ways that are not necessarily healthy or beneficial for the humans on the other end.

**Are you concerned about privacy?**

Not too much, but kind of - and getting more so I think. There are stories every day in the media but we all make our own judgments based on our own evidence.

**You're selfish for not giving the rest of us a window into your life!**

Get out of here, nosey parker.

**Don't you trust yourself to only use the good parts?**

No. And it's impossible to.

**You'll miss out on a lot of fun stuff!**

Not sure about that, but the rest of the Internet will still be there for me I suppose, if I want look at pictures of food, or videos of small animals and people falling over.

**Do you think that the rest of us Facebook users are deluded then?**

We all know that vanity plays a part in our social media usage, don't we now really?

**What about keeping up with distant friends and family?**

I'll probably miss that the most. But you know I still love you all x

**What will you do with all the time you save?**

Use it for the benefit of mankind, as a force for good, blah blah blah.

**Can you give me a reading list?**

Haha! No-one would really ask this question.
