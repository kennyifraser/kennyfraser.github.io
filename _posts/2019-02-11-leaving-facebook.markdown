title: "What, leaving Facebook? How dare you!"

Yep that's right. Leaving, one month short of 10 years of membership, it appears.  I still intend to continue to exist in real life though.  Here's my attempt to avoid the inevitable questions.

**But how will I get in touch with you in an Emergency?**

You might have my phone number, or use my email address which is at the bottom of this page.  And I'll still be on WhatsApp (I know, it's owned by Facebook). Or you might know my lovely wife who's a Facebook and Instagram ninja/addict. Maybe I'll even post more on this blog, just important and interesting stuff of course.

**Aren't you just fundamentally anti-social?**

Hope not, but that's for you to judge. Smiley winky face.

**But what's wrong with Facebook?**

They're pretty clever people, and they drive engagement with their platform in questionable ways that are maybe not altogether healthy or beneficial for the humans on the other end. If you're not paying for the product, you are the product.

**Are you concerned about privacy?**

Not too much, but kind of - and getting more so I think. There are stories every day in the media but we probably all prefer to make our own judgments based on our own evidence.

**Give me a reading list!**

Haha, no-one would really ask this question.
