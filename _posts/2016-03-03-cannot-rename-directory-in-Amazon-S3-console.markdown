Strange as it may seem, you can't directly rename folders in the Amazon S3 online console:

Files yes, but directories no.  As I had a batch to do, this was a bit of a pain.

There do seem to be wee Windows S3 clients that will offer this functionality though.  One which came to the rescue was the free [S3 Browser](http://s3browser.com/) which did the job, though just one directory at a time.  Install, plug in your access credentials and away you go.
