title: "Upgrading a Statamic site from v1 to v2"
---
[Statamic](//statamic.com) is a flat-file, [Laravel](//laravel.com/)-based content management system built and supported by [Wilderborn](//wilderborn.com/) ([Jack McDade](//twitter.com/jackmcdade), [Jason Varga](//twitter.com/jason_varga) and [Gareth Redfern](//twitter.com/garethredfern)).  It's great to work with.  I had the opportunity to upgrade a v1 site this week, so here's my tuppence-worth.  

The Statamic v2 documentation is excellent, taking the form of [Trail Guides](//docs.statamic.com/guides) as walk-through processes, and [Reference](//docs.statamic.com/reference) for the specific ingredients.  It's written in a conversational style with a liberal sprinkling of unselfconscious humour...  

Overall it's a case of:

* setting up a clean v2 installation, which includes example content
* transferring v1 files across in a sensible order - no database to worry about
* deactivating/deleting the example content and files

## v2 Installation

[Getting Started With Statamic](//docs.statamic.com/guides/getting-started) walks through setting up Statamic v2.  

[Mamp Pro](//www.mamp.info/en/) was the tool of choice for my local installation.  

To configure URL rewrites, the sample *.htaccess* file should really be used so */index.php/* is removed from resulting URLs.  

The *installer.php* file can be run locally to check requirements and set up a few handy things.  This seemed to cleverly delete itself after running locally, so I had to find it again to copy it up to the production server to check that.  For the production site I'm transferring hosts to get the required PHP >= 5.5.9 version, though this wasn't unexpected and not a big deal, with performance improvements also on offer at the new host.  *Zip archive support for updater backups* failed on production, and *always_populate_raw_post_data=-1* on both production and local.  Not to worry, for now at least.

System files can be [moved above webroot](//docs.statamic.com/reference/recipes/secure-installation) for additional security.  There's a bit of extra work there in adjusting default paths in settings files.

The one-click updater tool in v2 is a potentially great time-saving addition.

## Moving v1 Files

[You Can Get Here From There](//docs.statamic.com/guides/upgrading-from-v1) clears a path through the undergrowth for an upgrade from v1.

The v2 Control Panel is now located at *http://yourdomain/cp/* - this nugget tucked away in the docs under *New Defaults*. I went to *Tools : Import* to *Import content from Statamic v1*.  This instructs you to download an *exporter* add-on for installation into your **v1** site.  Visit the generated URL for a JSON string which can be pasted back into your v2 control panel.  The result was:

* v1 *Entries* were taken in as new v2 *Collections*
* *Pages* are transformed to their v2 equivalents 

Nice.

A few variables had to be renamed for the site to start working again - for example:

{% raw %}
{{ layout_content }} 
{% endraw %}

...becomes:

{% raw %}
{{ template_content }}
{% endraw %}

...and underscores needed removed from various variables.

The custom theme from the */themes/* directory had to be moved across manually.  The main change here was renaming *entries* in the template code:

{% raw %}
{{ entries:listing folder="example" }}...{{ /entries:listing }}
{% endraw %}

... as *collections*:

{% raw %}
{{ collection from="example" }}...{{ /collection }}
{% endraw %}

Assets can be similarly copied across from the v1 */assets/* directory to the corresponding v2 location.

## Removing v2 Example Files

Might be nice to have some additional documentation on exactly where all of this is located, for easy removal or editing.  Example content */pages/* and */collections/* subdirectory names can be prefixed with an underscore to hide but retain them for future reference.

That was it!  Up and running locally with v2.  The original v1 site wasn't enormously complicated but the principles would probably remain the same if it had been.  The main process just took a couple of hours as a first attempt, and the next v1 upgrade will go a lot quicker I'm sure.
