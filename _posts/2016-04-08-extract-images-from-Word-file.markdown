Here's a great wee tip [which I discovered here](http://cnedelcu.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/top-3-ways-to-extract-images-from-word-docx-doc-document.html), solving an issue which has bugged me for years.

If you need to extract images from a Word file that someone has supplied, at their original full resolution, just:

- Open then Save it from a current version of Word as a *.docx* file

- Duplicate and rename the Word file, changing the extension from *.docx* to *.zip*

- Open the unzipped directory and navigate to */filename/word/media/*

- Voilà! There they are.
