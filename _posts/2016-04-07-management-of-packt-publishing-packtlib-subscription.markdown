title: "Management of Packt Publishing's PacktLib Subscription"
---
[Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/) has a interesting option for online access to its publications, using a subscription service called [PacktLib](https://www.packtpub.com/packtlib).  Packt's content is on the technical side but excellent if it suits your needs, with up-to-date coverage of technologies.

At the time of writing, the recurring subscription charge is managed via [WorldPay](http://www.worldpay.com/) in the form of [FuturePay](http://support.worldpay.com/support/shopper/kb/shoppermanagementsystem/sms1200.html#recurring).  On signing up to PacktLib, you receive a confirmation from WorldPay with your *Agreement ID*, *Username* and a promise of a password (which didn't arrive separately in my case) to access your FuturePay subscription.

You can [request a FuturePay admin password](https://futurepay.worldpay.com/fp/jsp/common/login_shopper.jsp) using the details you already have, to access your recurring payment details and cancel if necessary.  There's no option to pause.  

To unsubscribe, Packt recommend you cancel the agreement with both themselves and WorldPay.  Then to re-subscribe a new FuturePay agreement is set up... 

I suppose the message to Packt Publishing is **if you'd like customers to continue to subscribe, make it super easy for them to temporarily unsubscribe**. The access is great but ideally we need to feel comfortable with managing our subscription during months when we're busier with other things.

[Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/support) does the subscription thing right.
